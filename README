LLP Socket Sender
  -This script is a socket sender over LLP (Low Level Protocol)
  - example call: perl llp_sender.pl -port 1234 -host localhost -path /home/user/files
  - Dependencies: perl, IO::Socket, File::Slurp (should both be installed with perl)
  - Cool stuff to do:
       - ...send stuff over TCP?
       - LLP is basically a level above TCP that wraps the data in hexidecimal headers/footers
           such as 0x0B (beginning of message), 0x1C (end of message), and 0x0D (end of segment)
